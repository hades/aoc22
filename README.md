# Advent of Code 2022

These are solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

To run, install nodejs and:

```bash
$ # Solve part 1 of day 1
$ tsc && node dist/main.js --day 01 < input.txt
$ # Solve part 2 of day 1
$ tsc && node dist/main.js --day 01 -2 < input.txt
```

PRs are welcome, especially if they teach me something new :)
